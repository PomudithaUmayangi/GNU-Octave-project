# 🚦 Intelligent Traffic Light Control System using GNU Octave

This project simulates an **intelligent traffic light control system** using **GNU Octave**, developed as part of our Discrete Mathematics coursework. It dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on flow, detects congestion, and prioritizes emergency vehicles — all through matrix operations and logical reasoning.

## 📌 Overview

Traditional traffic lights operate on fixed cycles, leading to inefficiencies in real-time traffic. This simulation introduces a **smart adaptive system** that:

✅ Simulates traffic over 24 hours across 4 directions and 6 lanes  
✅ Detects and prioritizes emergency vehicles  
✅ Dynamically adjusts green light durations based on vehicle count  
✅ Identifies peak traffic hours and congestion levels  
✅ Visualizes traffic flow using Octave plots  

> 🔍 Built using matrix operations, loops, conditionals, and discrete mathematics principles.
